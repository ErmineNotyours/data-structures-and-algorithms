# Linked List

**Author**: Arthur Allen

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
An exercise in manually creating and mainpulating a singly linked list by manipulating nodes.  This is tricky because a node only has its data and the memory location of the next node in the list

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Use Visual Studio 2017

## Example
<!-- Show them what it looks like and how to use the application.  -->
The tests are already hardcoded in the code

## Challenge
Tiger helped with getting adding a node at the end to work, and in creating test methods.

## Architecture
C#
