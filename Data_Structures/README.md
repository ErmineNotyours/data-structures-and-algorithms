## Overview

This is a higher-level guide to the projects in the Data Structures folder.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Access to the other projects

## Example
<!-- Show them what looks like and how how to use the application.  -->
Each project has hard-coded examples

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
+ The Linked List project demonstrates a linked list, a primitive predecessor of other data structures
+ The Stack project demonstrates a stack, a list where the first item entered is the last item out (FILO).
+ The Queue project demonstrates a queue, a list where the first item entered is the first item out (FIFO).
