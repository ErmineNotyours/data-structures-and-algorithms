## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Added functionality to add and delete some things. -->
04-01-2018 6:30 pm - All functionality, except for adding to an empty list.  I don't know how to add to an empty list.  Either the list has one empty item, in which the new item is added after, or I get an error as the loop tries to traverse a list that isn't there.
