**Author**: Arthur Allen

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Exercise in traversing a tree and processing data on the nodes.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Visual Studio 2017

## Example
<!-- Show them what looks like and how how to use the application.  -->
Hard coded example

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
C#.  Traverse the tree by way of techniques outlined in an earlier assignment.  Perform an operation on each node (Check for divisbility by 3 and/or 5).  Whiteboard: !(\..\..\data-structures-and-algorithms\assets\FizzBuzz.jpg)
