**Author**: Arthur Allen

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Linked list exercise, finding the kth node from the end.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Visual Studio 2017

## Example
<!-- Show them what looks like and how how to use the application.  -->
Demonstration is hard-coded in Program.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Added functionality to add and delete some things. -->
04-01-2018 7:50pm - Starting up the project
04-01-2018 8:41pm - Basic functionality, but a method that returns a value isn't compilable unless even exception conditions return a value.  Even when k exceeds the length of the list, a node will be returned (the first one) along with the exception.  Again, I will need guidence on this.
