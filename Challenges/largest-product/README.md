# Largest product of 2 adjacent values in a 2D array
Takes a two dimensional array and finds the highest multiplication product between two elements.

## Challenge
This seemed easy when comparing just pairs of elements along one dimension, but the other members of the team suggested a broader definition of "adjacent," including diagonal and back and forth in all directions.  Good thing, because when I commented out the added test suggested by the group, I didn't get the correct answer for the sample test.
