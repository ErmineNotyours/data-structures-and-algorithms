# Shift Array

**Author**: Arthur Allen

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
As an exercise in whiteboarding, Shift Array provides a challenge of array manipulation.  You must insert a number into an array without using special methods.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Use Visual Studio 2017

## Example
<!-- Show them what it looks like and how to use the application.  -->
The test array and the number to be inserted are hard-coded into the application

## Challenge
George Ceja,	Shannon Tully and David Snowberger helped with the whiteboard.
